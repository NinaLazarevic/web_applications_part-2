         <p>Persona 5 is a role-playing video game where the player takes on the role of a high school student who lives out a single year while attending high school in Tokyo: the game is governed by a day-night cycle and weather systems that determine general behavior similar to a social simulation. The year is punctuated by both scripted and random events — the protagonist attends school, can go to part-time jobs within Tokyo, and pursue leisure activities or create items for use in other areas of the game. </p>

      <h3>Setting and characters</h3>
      
      <p>Persona 5 takes place within the Persona universe: set in modern times, it revolves around a group of people who must face dark forces by harnessing Personas, manifestations of their inner psyche.[12] Rather than any specified date, the game's events begin in the year "20XX". Persona 5 is set in modern-day Tokyo, with navigable locations including Shinjuku and Shibuya, as well as the Greater Tokyo Area. Alongside larger environments, there are specific locations that can be entered such as shops. A major setting in Tokyo is Shujin Academy, which the Protagonist attends.There also exists a parallel realm known as Metaverse: born from the amalgamated hearts of humans, it holds multiple "Palaces", structures created from individuals' distorted desires.</p>     
      
      <p>The player character is a silent protagonist in common with other Persona games:
          he becomes the de facto leader of the "Phantom Thieves" vigilante group.
          His first companion is problem child Ryuji Sakamoto, who forms the group with the protagonist.
          A third founding member is Morgana, a mysterious cat-like creature they
          aid within the Metaverse. Over the course of the game, further people join the group, 
          including the withdrawn quarter-American Ann Takamaki; art protegee and Kousei
          Public High School student Yusuke Kitagawa; Shujin student council president Makoto Niijima;
          Futaba Sakura, a withdrawn first-year student with genius computer skills; and cultured heiress
          Haru Okumura. Also interacting with the protagonist are Goro Akechi,
          a high schooler and detective; Sae Nijima, a public prosecutor and Makoto's older sister; 
          and the residents of the Velvet Room, Igor and his two assistants Caroline and Justine.</p>

      <h3>Plot</h3>
      <p>A vigilante group called the Phantom Thieves of Hearts, led by the protagonist, is cornered inside a casino by police during a heist. The protagonist attempts to escape, but is captured, arrested, and taken to an interrogation room. There, public prosecutor Sae Nijima confronts him and demands an account of the events that led up to that point. The protagonist begins to tell his story.</p>

               <p>Preparation for development of the next Persona title began in 2010. 
                   Rumors of its development were floating around since 2009.
               </p>     
               <p>While the final game retained the turn-based system from earlier entries, one of the early design
                   drafts was for an action-based system incorporating real-time elements foreign to the series. This idea was ultimately scrapped,
                   but real-time command elements were introduced into the battle system, 
                   allowing the gameplay to evolve without any extensive change to the core system.
                   A major new addition was the inclusions of unique dungeons with locked layouts as opposed 
                   to the dominant randomly generated dungeons of previous Persona titles. 
                   This was done to both emulate the game's themes and provide veteran players with something different</p>

                        <p>The original story concept was written by Hashino.
                            The initial concept was for a storyline that diverged 
                            from the established paths of Persona 3 and Persona 4, with "self-discovery"
                            and "journey" being its keywords.Originally using the frame story of a 
                            backpacking trip around the world, Hashino decided to refocus on Japan in
                            the wake of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake.Following that, and seeing the way 
                            people were bonding in the face of the crisis, Hashino decided to have the 
                            story take place solely in Japan, with the journeying being through the ever-shifting Palace.
                            According to Hashino, the central theme of the game is freedom and how the characters attain it.</p>

                        <p>Shigenori Soejima, who had worked on the last two main-series Persona titles, 
                            returned as character designer.The game's art director was Masayoshi Suto, 
                            whose most notable work on earlier titles included the user interface (UI)
                            displays.The art design reflected the picaresque theme aimed for by the rest
                            of the team.According to Soejima, he was working on designs for the
                            then-prospective Persona 5 while the previous game was still in development:
                            his designs evolved as the story for Persona 5 came together. Aesthetically, the team felt that they
                            were picking up where Persona 4 left off. Its styling presentation was an unintentional
                            reflection on the hurdles the team needed to overcome during development.
                            The thematic color of the game is red, as that of Persona 3 and 4 was blue and yellow respectively.
                            The red color was meant to convey a harsh feeling.</p>

                            and further vocal themes were sung by Lyn Inaizumi, which was her first performance
